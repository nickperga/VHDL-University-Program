# VHDL-University-Program
This was a vhdl program we made in university with another girl as an exercise in which we create a 16-bit ALU which uses a control circuit so as to take its op code.
It contains a 1-bit ALU, a bit inverter, a full-adder and the control circuit which are used as components in the 16-bit ALU
